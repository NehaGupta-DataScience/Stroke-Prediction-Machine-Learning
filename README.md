# Stroke-Prediction-Machine-Learning
The objective of the investigation would be building the prediction model which would be assist the health care workers to detect the stroke at an early stage. 
Data exploration was performed on dataset which give the information such as data features, statistical characteristics. Visualization was performed by using bar charts, histograms for univariate and multivariate analysis.
Label encoding is done before building any machine learning model to convert the labels in numerical format. 
Random Forest Classification Model was used for building predictive model.
